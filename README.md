I am a recent graduate from UC Irvine, with a bachelors in Quantitative Economics. I hope to pursue
a field in data sciene or data analysis. The reason I took this course is to gain more hands on 
experience with different programs and programming language. In my time at UCI, I was able to learn 
about the quantitative aspect of data science, but did not have much work with coding and different programs.
That is the main reason for me taking this course and the overall program.
